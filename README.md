# DynamicForexTrader Trading System

DynamicForexTrader is an automated trading system designed to operate on the Foreign Exchange Market (FOREX) through the utilization of **Python**, effectively interfacing with the **OANDA API** and **tpqoa** for trading execution. It features a class-oriented strategy implementation, empowering traders to freely create an array of distinct strategies, with the flexibility to specify/adjust specific parameters to dynamically mutate the operational trading strategy. <br /><br />

The system also includes a binary classification deep neural network (DNN). I engineered and trained the DNN on over 40,000 data points, which utilizes binary cross-entropy loss and sigmoid activation for market prediction with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn. <br /><br />
